{"name":"Filesharing2.0.github.io","tagline":"A File Sharing Service Based Upon BTSync","body":"### Welcome to My File Sharing Project.\r\nThis was a short venture into the world of P2P sharing, in which I created a simple solution for remote file sharing. By combining BitTorrent Sync with a remote server, one can store, share, version and archive files with ease. \r\n\r\n**Installing BTSync on an Ubuntu Server**\r\n\r\nStep 1: Install\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd /tmp\r\nmkdir btsync\r\ncd btsync\r\nwget http://btsync.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/\tbtsync_x64.tar.gz .\r\ntar -xvzf btsync_x64.tar.gz\r\n```\r\n-\r\nStep 2: Setup Password Access\r\nIn order to do so you must make a .config file in the btsync folder. Here is a sample of a btsync.config file.\r\n\r\n_{\r\n \r\n  \"device_name\": \"My Sync Device\",\r\n  \"listening_port\" : 0,                       // 0 - randomize port\r\n  \r\n/* storage_path dir contains auxilliary app files\r\n   if no storage_path field: .sync dir created in the directory \r\n   where binary is located.\r\n   otherwise user-defined directory will be used \r\n*/\r\n  \"storage_path\" : \"/home/user/.sync\",\r\n\r\n// uncomment next line if you want to set location of pid file\r\n// \"pid_file\" : \"/var/run/syncapp/syncapp.pid\",\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"check_for_updates\" : true, \r\n  \"use_upnp\" : true,                              // use UPnP for port mapping\r\n\r\n\r\n/* limits in kB/s\r\n   0 - no limit\r\n*/\r\n  \"download_limit\" : 0,                       \r\n  \"upload_limit\" : 0, \r\n\r\n/* remove \"listen\" field to disable WebUI\r\n   remove \"login\" and \"password\" fields to disable credentials check\r\n*/\r\n  \"webui\" :\r\n  {\r\n    \"listen\" : \"0.0.0.0:8888\",\r\n    \"login\" : \"admin\",\r\n    \"password\" : \"password\"\r\n  }\r\n\r\n/* !!! if you set shared folders in config file WebUI will be DISABLED !!!\r\n   shared directories specified in config file\r\n   override the folders previously added from WebUI.\r\n*/\r\n/*\r\n  ,\r\n  \"shared_folders\" :\r\n  [\r\n    {\r\n//  use --generate-secret in command line to create new secret\r\n      \"secret\" : \"MY_SECRET_1\",                   // * required field\r\n      \"dir\" : \"/home/user/bittorrent/sync_test\", // * required field\r\n\r\n//  use relay server when direct connection fails\r\n      \"use_relay_server\" : true,\r\n      \"use_tracker\" : true, \r\n      \"use_dht\" : false,\r\n      \"search_lan\" : true,\r\n//  enable sync trash to store files deleted on remote devices\r\n      \"use_sync_trash\" : true,\r\n//  specify hosts to attempt connection without additional search     \r\n      \"known_hosts\" :\r\n      [\r\n        \"192.168.1.2:44444\",\r\n        \"myhost.com:6881\"\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n*/\r\n\r\n// Advanced preferences can be added to config file.\r\n// Info is available in BitTorrent Sync User Guide.\r\n\r\n}_\r\n\r\nIn this file you simply have to change the \"login\" and \"password.\"  It is currently set to its default which is admin and password. \r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nStep 3: RUN\r\nyouripaddress:8888/gui\r\n\r\nWhen you access the IP Address it should look like this.\r\n\r\n![my face](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10201526535156065&set=a.1557137779184.72836.1557425990&type=1&theater)\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT FACETS OF BTSYNC**\r\n\r\n-Versioning-\r\n\r\nBy default it creates and stores all the old copies of edited ﬁles for the period of 30 days (this period can be changed in General advanced preferences - sync_trash_ttl). All the versions are stored in the hidden .SyncArchive directory within your sync folder that you can open by right click on the sync folder and choosing ‘Open SyncArchive’.\r\n\r\nIf you have any other question you can find the BTSync Users Guide online or contact me.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
