By combining BitTorrent Sync with a remote server, one can store, share, version and archive files with ease. \r\n\r\n###Installing BTSync on an Ubuntu Server\r\n\r\n**Step 1: Install**\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd /tmp\r\nmkdir btsync\r\ncd btsync\r\nwget http://btsync.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/\tbtsync_x64.tar.gz .\r\ntar -xvzf btsync_x64.tar.gz\r\n```\r\n-\r\n**Step 2: Setup Password Access**\r\nIn order to do so you must make a .config file in the btsync folder. Here is a sample of a btsync.config file.\r\n\r\n_{\r\n \r\n  \"device_name\": \"My Sync Device\",\r\n  \"listening_port\" : 0,                       // 0 - randomize port\r\n  \r\n/* storage_path dir contains auxilliary app files\r\n   if no storage_path field: .sync dir created in the directory \r\n   where binary is located.\r\n   otherwise user-defined directory will be used \r\n*/\r\n  \"storage_path\" : \"/home/user/.sync\",\r\n\r\n// uncomment next line if you want to set location of pid file\r\n// \"pid_file\" : \"/var/run/syncapp/syncapp.pid\",\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"check_for_updates\" : true, \r\n  \"use_upnp\" : true,                              // use UPnP for port mapping\r\n\r\n\r\n/* limits in kB/s\r\n   0 - no limit\r\n*/\r\n  \"download_limit\" : 0,                       \r\n  \"upload_limit\" : 0, \r\n\r\n/* remove \"listen\" field to disable WebUI\r\n   remove \"login\" and \"password\" fields to disable credentials check\r\n*/\r\n  \"webui\" :\r\n  {\r\n    \"listen\" : \"0.0.0.0:8888\",\r\n    \"login\" : \"admin\",\r\n    \"password\" : \"password\"\r\n  }\r\n\r\n/* !!! if you set shared folders in config file WebUI will be DISABLED !!!\r\n   shared directories specified in config file\r\n   override the folders previously added from WebUI.\r\n*/\r\n/*\r\n  ,\r\n  \"shared_folders\" :\r\n  [\r\n    {\r\n//  use --generate-secret in command line to create new secret\r\n      \"secret\" : \"MY_SECRET_1\",                   // * required field\r\n      \"dir\" : \"/home/user/bittorrent/sync_test\", // * required field\r\n\r\n//  use relay server when direct connection fails\r\n      \"use_relay_server\" : true,\r\n      \"use_tracker\" : true, \r\n      \"use_dht\" : false,\r\n      \"search_lan\" : true,\r\n//  enable sync trash to store files deleted on remote devices\r\n      \"use_sync_trash\" : true,\r\n//  specify hosts to attempt connection without additional search     \r\n      \"known_hosts\" :\r\n      [\r\n        \"192.168.1.2:44444\",\r\n        \"myhost.com:6881\"\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n*/\r\n\r\n// Advanced preferences can be added to config file.\r\n// Info is available in BitTorrent Sync User Guide.\r\n\r\n}_\r\n\r\nIn this file you simply have to change the \"login\" and \"password.\"  It is currently set to its default which is admin and password. \r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n**Step 3: RUN**\r\n\r\nyouripaddress:8888/gui\r\n\r\nWhen you access the IP address it should look like this.\r\n\r\n![BT SYNC](http://nickology.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/btsyncgui.png)\r\n\r\nAfter this using the software is quite simple. Firstly, you must download the software to your computer. \r\nIt looks something like this depending on what OS your running on. \r\n\r\n![User Interface](http://www.soft32.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/btsync.jpg.png)\r\n\r\nTo share a folder you simply click Folders tab. Once you have done that you select which folder you would like to sync from your computer. Then the software will create a secret which you can share with another device. \r\nFor example, if you were to share the folder with the server you have just created you simply hit the add folder button and input the secret that was generated. Once this is done the software will begin to sync the folders between the devices. It should only take a maximum of 10 minutes. \r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT FACETS OF BTSYNC**\r\n\r\n-Versioning-\r\n\r\nBy default it creates and stores all the old copies of edited ﬁles for the period of 30 days (this period can be changed in General advanced preferences - sync_trash_ttl). All the versions are stored in the hidden .SyncArchive directory within your sync folder that you can open by right click on the sync folder and choosing ‘Open SyncArchive’.\r\n\r\n**The Future**\r\n\r\nOne can also combine BTSync with Owncloud to provide better organization of files. This way one doesn't have to go through the terminal to access files from the Server. \r\n\r\nHere is a link that shows you how to combine the two with a Raspberry Pi. You can simply treat the Raspberry Pi as a server and follow the same general steps. \r\n[CLICK HERE](http://blog.bittorrent.com/2013/05/23/how-i-created-my-own-personal-cloud-using-bittorrent-sync-owncloud-and-raspberry-pi/)\r\n\r\nIf you have any other question you can find the BTSync Users Guide online or contact me.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
